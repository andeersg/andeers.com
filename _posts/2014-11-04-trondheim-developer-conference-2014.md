Last week I attended Trondheim Developer Conference [#tdconf][1] in Trondheim. It was the first conference I have attended and I must say it was fun and inspiring. I really liked going, and it was a nice way to learn new stuff and see interesting people you usually only see on Twitter.

The conference consisted of 5 venues with 8 talks on each during the day plus three talks for everyone. It was a long day with lots of talks, and here are some of my favorites.

## The better parts

[Douglas Crockford][2] talked about the better parts of javascript and the new stuff in ECMAScript6.

## Managing CSS Projects with ITCSS

[Harry Roberts][3] held the first talk about his new approach for managing CSS projects, ITCSS. To optimize CSS you should structure it in a way where low specificity comes first. Harry has written more about that in his article [The Specificity Graph][4].

## How HTML5 missed its graduation day

[Christian Heilmann][5] talked about HTML5 and that we should not be afraid to use it. People with old browsers who don&#8217;t support new features does not expect to get fancy awesome features and we should not try to create the same experience for everybody.

## Designing with Sensors: Creating Adaptive Experiences

[Avi Itzkovitch][6] talked about designing apps and user interfaces that uses sensors and data to adapt its behavior to the users needs. It was a very interesting talk about how we can use the data we have about the user to create a better experience.

## SVG is for everyone

[Chris Coyier][7] talked about SVG, and it was one of the talks i was looking forward to upfront. SVG has a lot of advantages over icon fonts and regular images and i really look forward to try it on a project soon.

## Hacking the Creative Brain

[Denise Jacobs][8] talked about how developers are creative and how to trigger the creative parts of the brain.

I had a good time and i look forward to next year, i also hope i get to go to some other conferences in the future as well.
