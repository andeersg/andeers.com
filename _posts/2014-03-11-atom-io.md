Github just released a beta version of their new editor Atom, and i must say it looks good.

It has a very clean user interface, and i must say i like what i see.<figure id="attachment_881" style="width: 640px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

The editor is highly flexible with loads of packages you can download. A package can be a theme for the editor or new features and functions. A couple of packages highlighted on the atom.io site:

  * [Color picker][1]
  * [JSHint][2]

Another small feature i like is that if your working on files inside a git repository, it displays the current branch, and how many lines changed from whats currently in git.<figure id="attachment_888" style="width: 340px;" class="wp-caption center">

The editor also have a shortcut `cmd+shift+p` which opens a search-form that allows you to search in every function available.

For example if your writing markdown you can search for a function that gives you a preview:  
<figure id="attachment_895" style="width: 497px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/atom-search.gif" alt="Search for whatever function you like." width="497" height="375" class="size-full wp-image-895" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Search for whatever function you like.</figcaption></figure>

## My impression so far

I like the possibilities and that there are lots of customization and plugins for it. The one thing i miss most from [Coda][3] is the built-in SFTP-file manager, i love being able to open remote files from inside the editor and not have to use another program for that.

I don&#8217;t think it has any killer features that would instantly make me switch from Coda, but it&#8217;s a great editor and i will absolutely recommend it, you can apply for beta access at [Atom.io][4].
