tldr: How to enable Github's new feature to show a readme on your profile.
---
To make your Github profile page more interesting you can now create a readme file that will be displayed at the top of your profile.

This "feature" is kind of hidden, but it's straight forward to enable it. You just have to create a new repository with the same name
as your username. For example my username is `andeersg`, so I created a repository called `andeersg` with a `README.md`.

Now I have a new section on my profile with the content of that `README.md`.
