* I work at [NyMedia](http://nymedia.no "NyMedia"), a Norwegian Drupal company.


## This website

Right now this blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), and hosted at [Github](https://github.com/andeersg/andeersg.github.io "The source code of this repo").
For a long time this blog was powered by WordPress, but I discovered Jekyll and realized it suited me better.
