This website is 10 years old! My first blog post was posted on the 18th of March 2011, as a part of a college course about social media.

There have been multiple changes since then:
* Switching from Norwegian to English
* Writing about web development
* Removing Google Analytics in favor of Netlify Analytics
* Many design attempts and iterations
* Tech stack

My website has always been a place for me to test things, so it's gone through some changes over the years.

It started with WordPress (self hosted), moved to Jekyll (on Github Pages), and finally moved to Eleventy (on Netlify).

So far I've been really happy with Eleventy and see no reason to switch.
