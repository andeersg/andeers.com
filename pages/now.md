Currently my main work focus is Drupal 8. I also try to focus on React and frontend in general. Outside work I focus on finishing some of my home projects.

Other stuff happening now:

* I recently went to [Drupal Europe](https://drupaleurope.org "Drupal Europe") in Darmstadt, Germany.
* I just created a small static site generator written in Node. [Check it out](https://github.com/andeersg/raccn "Raccn").
